# Personal portfolio

Personal portfolio description...

## Current bugs:

- Certificates coesnt scroll to the top of the section when view all button is clicked? - It maybe does but it feels like it does it only at random.
- When it scrolls it scrolls up to little. It should probably use a negative offset when using the smoothscroll.
- The ZippiUX project youtube video is sized weirdly. Make it take up as much space as the other thumbnails.

## TODO:

- Create and develop these layouts:
  - Testimonials
  - Footer (not important at the moment)
- Add a Lotus image
- Add animations
